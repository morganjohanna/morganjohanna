### Hi there, I'm Johanna (she/her) 👋

I'm working as a BI Consultant at COMAVA in Germany, specifically applying my skills in Planful, Python, SQL, and more to help streamline customers' complex BI and financial performance management landscapes.
I have more than a decade of practical analytics work as well as experience in project and stakeholder management as an academic, strategy manager, senior specialist salesperson, and official unofficial "Excel person" since forever. I am a lifelong learner and see problems as puzzles I love to solve.

I actually enjoy cleaning data (really!) and engineering challenges.

In May 2023 I finished a 12-week intensive data science course from [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science#) focused on the following:
- Expanding Python (with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Expanding statistics knowledge with neural networks, NLP, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and methods
- PostgreSQL and database management
- Container (Docker) and ETL pipeline management
- Working with cloud instances as an admin (EC2 and RDS on AWS)

This is a little of what I was up to before I started my course in an academic and professional context:
- Descriptive statistics/EDA
- Complex statistics (cluster analysis, multivariate discriminant analysis, ANOVA) with SPSS
- Excel/Sheets power user
- Dashboard and report building and admin with Salesforce

Fun facts about me!
- I used to be an osteoarchaeologist, aka official grave robber 🤠
- I have a border collie 🐶 who is the goodest
- I like through hiking, wild camping, bouldering, and scuba diving 🏞️🏕️🤿
- I am an active Nordic larper and larpwright

Also, do I want to collaborate on your project? It definitely doesn't hurt to ask!
