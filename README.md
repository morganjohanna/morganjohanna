### Hi there, I'm Johanna (she/her) 👋

I'm pivoting to a new career in data engineering/data science to apply years of experience in the tech industry. I come with hard skills in SQL, Python, and Docker honed over more than year of study (both self-directed and formal) and built on a decade of practical analytics work and project and stakeholder management as an academic, strategy manager, senior specialist salesperson, and unofficial official "Excel person" in every team. I am a lifelong learner and see problems as puzzles I love to solve.

In May 2023 I finished a 12-week intensive data science course from [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science#) focused on the following:
- Expanding Python (with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Expanding statistics knowledge with neural networks, NLP, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and methods
- PostgreSQL and database management
- Container (Docker) and ETL pipeline management
- Working with cloud instances as an admin (EC2 and RDS on AWS)

I especially enjoyed engineering challenges and would like to move into a new role as soon as possible with a strong data engineering component. Have a look at my repos to see some of the projects and challenges I've been working on.

This is a little of what I was up to before my course:
- Descriptive statistics/EDA
- Advanced statistics (cluster analysis, multivariate discriminant analysis, ANOVA) with SPSS
- Everyone's Excel/Sheets person since forever
- Dashboarding building and admin with Tableau and Salesforce

Fun facts about me!
- I used to be an osteoarchaeologist, aka official grave robber 🤠
- I have a border collie 🐶 who is the goodest
- I like through hiking, wild camping, bouldering, and scuba diving 🏞️🏕️🤿
- I am an active Nordic larper and larpwright

I'm actively looking for my next role so am very open to new opportunities in Berlin.  

Also, do I want to collaborate on your project? It definitely doesn't hurt to ask!
